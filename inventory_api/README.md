# ZeroX Inventory Management and Order Processing System

## Introduction
This is a README file for the ZeroX Inventory Management and Order Processing System. The system is designed to manage the inventory and order processing for ZeroX, a company that supplies blasting materials to artisan mines in Wakanda. The system is built using Elixir/Phoenix and focuses on handling tasks such as managing inventory, processing orders, and coordinating shipments.

## Requirements
- Elixir/Phoenix or other backend programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript)
- Database system (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- Message queuing system (e.g., RabbitMQ)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Configure the database connection
4. Set up the message queuing system
5. Run the database migrations
6. Start the application

## Functionality
The system provides the following main functionalities:

### 1. Initialization
- `init_catalog(product_info)`: Initializes the catalog with the provided product information. This function is called once at the beginning of the program before any calls to `process_restock` or `process_order`. After `init_catalog` is called, the system assumes 0 quantity for each product type.

### 2. Inventory Management
- `process_restock(restock)`: Processes a restock event when new products are added to the inventory. The function takes a list of products and their quantities to be added to the inventory. If there are any pending orders (or partial orders) that were not previously shipped, they should be shipped immediately as a result of this function call.

### 3. Order Processing
- `process_order(order)`: Processes an incoming order from a mine site. The function takes an order description containing the order ID and the requested products with their quantities. The system should eventually invoke `ship_package` (multiple times if necessary) such that all the products listed in the order are shipped. However, products that have not yet been stocked as part of the inventory should not be shipped. Each package has a maximum mass of 134.8 kg.

### 4. Shipping
- `ship_package(shipment)`: A stub API that represents the shipping of a package. In reality, this would feed a user interface informing a fulfillment operator to pack and ship the package. For the purpose of this system, it prints out the shipment details to the console.

## Endpoints
The system exposes the following API endpoints:

1. `POST /api/init_catalog`
   - Description: Initializes the catalog with the provided product information.
   - Request Body: JSON array of product objects
   - Response: 200 OK if the initialization is successful, 400 Bad Request if the request is invalid

2. `POST /api/process_restock`
   - Description: Processes a restock event and updates the inventory.
   - Request Body: JSON array of restock objects
   - Response: 200 OK if the restock is processed successfully, 400 Bad Request if the request is invalid

3. `POST /api/process_order`
   - Description: Processes an incoming order and coordinates the shipping of packages.
   - Request Body: JSON object representing the order
   - Response: 200 OK if the order is processed successfully, 400 Bad Request if the request is invalid

4. `POST /api/ship_package`
   - Description: A stub API for shipping a package.
   - Request Body: JSON object representing the shipment
   - Response: 200 OK if the shipment is printed successfully, 400 Bad Request if the request is invalid

## Test Cases
The system should handle the following test cases:

1. Initialize the catalog with a valid product information JSON.
2. Process a restock event with valid restock data and verify that the inventory is updated correctly.
3. Process an order with valid order data and verify that the packages are shipped correctly, respecting the maximum package mass limit.
4. Process an order with requested products that are not currently in stock and verify that the shipping is deferred until a restock event occurs.
5. Process multiple orders and restock events in different sequences and verify that the system maintains the correct inventory and shipping state.
6. Attempt to process an order with invalid data (e.g., missing fields, invalid product IDs) and verify that the system returns an appropriate error response.
7. Attempt to process a restock event with invalid data and verify that the system returns an appropriate error response.
8. Verify that the system handles concurrent requests correctly and maintains data consistency.

## Edge Cases
The system should handle the following edge cases:

1. Processing an order with a requested quantity that exceeds the available inventory.
2. Processing a restock event with a product ID that does not exist in the catalog.
3. Processing an order with a total mass that exceeds the maximum package mass limit, requiring multiple shipments.
4. Processing an order with no requested products.
5. Processing a restock event with zero quantity for a product.
6. Handling concurrent requests to process orders and restock events.
7. Handling system failures or crashes during order processing or inventory updates.

## Error Handling
The system should handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error responses to the API clients. Some common error scenarios include:

- Invalid request data (e.g., missing fields, invalid data types)
- Product not found in the catalog
- Insufficient inventory to fulfill an order
- Database or message queuing system unavailable
- Internal server errors

## Logging and Monitoring
The system should implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track important events, errors, and performance metrics. This can help in debugging issues, monitoring system health, and making data-driven decisions for improvements.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize the performance of the system, consider the following:

- Use appropriate database indexing to speed up query performance
- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the database for frequently accessed data
- Utilize message queuing to handle asynchronous processing and decouple components
- Employ concurrency techniques to handle multiple requests simultaneously
- Monitor and profile the system to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly

## Security Considerations
Ensure that the system follows security best practices, such as:

- Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive endpoints and data
- Validating and sanitizing user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)
- Encrypting sensitive data both in transit and at rest
- Regularly updating dependencies and applying security patches
- Implementing rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse and protect against DoS attacks

## Deployment and Scalability
The system should be designed and deployed with scalability in mind. Consider the following:

- Use containerization technologies like Docker for easy deployment and scaling
- Implement horizontal scaling by running multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer
- Utilize cloud platforms or container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for automated scaling and management
- Design the system with loose coupling and modularity to allow for independent scaling of components

## Documentation
Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the system, including:

- API documentation with endpoint descriptions, request/response formats, and error codes
- Setup and installation instructions
- Configuration guidelines
- Deployment and scaling considerations
- Troubleshooting and error handling guidelines

## Conclusion
This README provides an overview of the ZeroX Inventory Management and Order Processing System, including its functionality, endpoints, test cases, edge cases, error handling, performance considerations, security considerations, deployment and scalability, and documentation. By following the guidelines outlined in this README, developers can ensure a robust, efficient, and scalable system for managing inventory and processing orders for ZeroX.
